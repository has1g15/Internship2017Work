This simple express application allows users to be created and added to an Amazon Cognito user pool, users' passwords to be changed as well as reset in the case they have forgotten them.
Before you begin you will need:
- An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, you can make a free account if you don't already have one.
- The aws command line to perform certain operations.
- A rest client, we are using Postman.
For setting up the express server, we will provide instructions to (1) Create a DynamoDB table, (2) Create an API and (3) Create a Cognito user pool.

(1) Creating a DynamoDB table

First, go to DynamoDB on AWS and set up a database of users. Click "DynamoDB" or simply type it into the search bar.

Then, click "Create Table" to create the database.

![ddb createtable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28771941-84e283ca-75dc-11e7-9fce-4abd016d12ab.png)

Give the table an appropriate name and specify a Primary Key, a unique identifier for each item. Then press create table.

(2) Creating an API

To create an API we will first need to make a lambda function. To do this, go to the AWS homepage and type "Lambda" into the search bar.
Once you're there, select "Create lambda function".

![api create lambda](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28820677-6d7cf084-76aa-11e7-9bca-19e723e129fc.png)

Then choose the "simple-mobile-backend" blueprint, you can filter the blueprints by typing in the text box at the top.

![api select blueprint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28819884-7ff07928-76a7-11e7-859f-c764bf22dc38.png)

Give a name to your Lambda function and leave the settings as default as shown in the image below.

![api configure function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28820164-9743fd24-76a8-11e7-8d7f-08de2288392d.png)

For Role, select "Create new role from template(s)" and give it a name. Change the timeout to 10 seconds and leave everything else as default as shown in the image below. Then click "Create function".

![api lambda role](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28820496-c4fce1f8-76a9-11e7-9dc9-69f432a24f4f.png)

Now navigate to Amazon API Gateway from the AWS homepage by clicking the icon or simply typing "API" into the search bar.
Then click "Create API".

![api create api](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28819050-d8a5a65e-76a4-11e7-8ee2-1f72099ba8f2.png)

Select "New API" and give your API a name, then you can create your API.

![api creating api](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28819339-d78e6f02-76a5-11e7-8c88-e1cde5258ec1.png)

Go to "Actions" and select "Create new resource". Give your resource a name and tick the "Enable API Gateway CORS" box. Then click "Create Resource".

![api new resource](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28819504-60279e92-76a6-11e7-811f-e971c0a29944.png)

Go to "Actions" again and choose "Create method", then select "POST" under Options.

![api userdao method](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28819656-d6cd9e66-76a6-11e7-9bfb-a1c9a3e1a0aa.png)

Select your region for lambda region and select your lambda function. Then click "Create API".

Then go to Options and select "Deploy API".

![api deploy api](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28820834-05348f2c-76ab-11e7-958e-8c6999095117.png)

Select "new stage" and call it dev for development. Then press "Deploy", this will take a little while to complete.

![api deploying api](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28820857-1b06c0b8-76ab-11e7-9ba5-e792762d6222.png)

On the left hand side, select "Stages" and then select "dev", select your API and select "POST". Copy the link called "Invoke URL".

![api url](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28821468-725f925c-76ad-11e7-917e-329786ed4da4.png)

Open up your rest client and paste the link into the top section.
Then select POST and enter JSON similar to what is shown in the image below, using the name of your table and the names and attributes you desire, remembering to include the primary key.

![api add user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28822843-c655ae46-76b2-11e7-9e07-d22475da4fcb.png)

If you go to DynamoDB, under the Items tab you can see the newly added user.

![api data evidence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28823049-a9241e92-76b3-11e7-9344-eeef03b87cee.png)

(3) Creating a Cognito user pool

Next, go to Cognito from the Amazon Web Services homepage by clicking on the icon or simply typing "Cognito" into the search bar.

![cognito screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28772512-5cdbb66a-75de-11e7-94c8-77adb260aba9.png)

Click on "Manage your User Pools", then click "Create User Pool".

![cognito manage pools](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28772654-aeb3407a-75de-11e7-9832-41cf996ab8da.png)

Give a name to your user pool and when prompted click "Step through settings"

![cognito step settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28772796-2b3da2c0-75df-11e7-8691-c0be800b74d5.png)

Choose the standard attributes, email is recommended, and choose the password strength, amazon recommends a minimum length of 8 characters.
Then select if users can sign themselves up and specify how long until an unconfirmed account expires.
On the next page, leave all the settings as default and click "Create Role".

Personalise your verification messages as you wish.

![cognito personalise message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28774920-721eee30-75e7-11e7-8ff1-ab8ff3e2302d.png)

Add a tag to your user pool.

![cognito tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28775172-82b225d6-75e8-11e7-8249-5e5921763bbc.png)

Now you can create your application.

![cognito create app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9966869/28775306-1fe7437c-75e9-11e7-96ec-e0282ddc1469.png)

Click "Create Pool" and you are done!
Our code will automatically add users from the DynamoDB table into the Cognito user pool with a default password of Password1.
You can change this and other things from the command line, this link provides all the aws cognito commands: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-idp/index.html

Here are the operations you can perform with our code:

1. Creating users

Initially users can be added via a rest client by providing an API gateway URL, and JSON data for payload, as detailed above.
Here is an example of a user being created:

{
  "operation": "create",
  "payload": {
      "TableName": "UserDetailsDev",
      "Item": {
          "Username": "exampleUser",
          "Email": "exampleUser@mailinator.com",
          "Mobile": "07111111111",
          "Course": "BScCompSci"
      }
  }
}

This will add the user to a DynamoDB table "UserDetailsDev" on Amazon Web Services.

The application is designed to add users to the Cognito user pool if they exist in the DynamoDB table but aren't yet in the user pool, enabling them to have a password - set as default to Password1.

2. Changing a user's password

On the change password page of the express server, you can simulate a user's change of password - a random user will be chosen and their password changed by the application which executes the change-password Cognito command.

For future development, the application could have a front end in which the user enters their choice of new password as well as their previous password.

3. Resetting a user's password

This action is carried out in a similar way to changing password, the application randomly changes a user's password.

For future development, the application would have a front end in which a user could input their username and the application would execute the forgot-password Cognito command.
The user would receive an email with an authentication code to put into the front end and then reset their password from there.

4. Authentication via a token

At the moment, if you go onto the rest client, go to the URL https://localhost:3000/login and type in the header a valid username and password then Send a GET request, you will receive an access token.
If you then go to the URL https://localhost:3000/getRefresh and type in "Authorisation" for the key in the header, then "JWT " followed by the access token, you will receive a refresh token.
You will not receive it if an invalid access token is used.
Similarly, if you go to https://localhost:3000/getNewAccess and again type in "name" as a key in the body followed by the same username you used in /login, as well as "refreshToken" with the refresh token you received in /getRefresh, then you will receive a new access token.
You will not receive a new access token if an invalid refresh token or name is used.

=================================================================================

Deploying application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

- Dockerize web application before deployment 
  - Create a Dockerfile, using following as example:
  
  
  ```
